.SH "NAME"
systemd.network \- Network configuration
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fInetwork\fR\&.network
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Network setup is performed by
\fBsystemd-networkd\fR(8)\&.
.PP
Network files must have the extension
\&.network; other extensions are ignored\&. Networks are applied to links whenever the links appear\&.
.PP
The
\&.network
files are read from the files located in the system network directory
/usr/lib/systemd/network, the volatile runtime network directory
/run/systemd/network
and the local administration network directory
/etc/systemd/network\&. All configuration files are collectively sorted and processed in lexical order, regardless of the directories in which they live\&. However, files with identical filenames replace each other\&. Files in
/etc
have the highest priority, files in
/run
take precedence over files with the same name in
/usr/lib\&. This can be used to override a system\-supplied configuration file with a local file if needed; a symlink in
/etc
with the same name as a configuration file in
/usr/lib, pointing to
/dev/null, disables the configuration file entirely\&.
.SH "[MATCH] SECTION OPTIONS"
.PP
The network file contains a
"[Match]"
section, which determines if a given network file may be applied to a given device; and a
"[Network]"
section specifying how the device should be configured\&. The first (in lexical order) of the network files that matches a given device is applied, all later files are ignored, even if they match as well\&.
.PP
A network file is said to match a device if each of the entries in the
"[Match]"
section matches, or if the section is empty\&. The following keys are accepted:
.PP
\fIMACAddress=\fR
.RS 4
The hardware address\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIPath=\fR

"DRIVER"
of its parent device, or if that is not set the driver as exposed by
"ethtool \-i"
of the device itself\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIType=\fR
.RS 4

in
\fBsystemd.unit\fR(5)
for details\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIArchitecture=\fR

.PP
\fIMACAddress=\fR
.RS 4
The hardware address\&.

below\&.
.RE
.PP

"ipv6"\&.
.RE

.PP
\fIBindCarrier=\fR
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
\fIAddress=\fR
.RS 4
A static IPv4 or IPv6 address and its prefix length, separated by a
"/"
character\&. Specify this key more than once to configure several addresses\&. The format of the address must be as described in
\fBinet_pton\fR(3)\&. This is a short\-hand for an [Address] section only containing an Address key (see below)\&. This option may be specified more than once\&.
.sp
If the specified address is 0\&.0\&.0\&.0 (for IPv4) or [::] (for IPv6), a new address range of the requested size is automatically allocated from a system\-wide pool of unused ranges\&. The allocated range is checked against all current network interfaces and all known network configuration files to avoid address range conflicts\&. The default system\-wide pool consists of 192\&.168\&.0\&.0/16, 172\&.16\&.0\&.0/12 and 10\&.0\&.0\&.0/8 for IPv4, and fc00::/7 for IPv6\&. This functionality is useful to manage a large number of dynamically created network interfaces with the same network configuration and automatic address range assignment\&.

.RS 4
Configures IP forwarding for the network interface\&. If enabled incoming packets on the network interface will be forwarded to other interfaces according to the routing table\&. Takes either a boolean argument, or the values
"ipv4"
or
"ipv6", which only enables IP forwarding for the specified address family, or
"kernel", which preserves existing sysctl settings\&. This controls the
net\&.ipv4\&.conf\&.<interface>\&.forwarding
and
net\&.ipv6\&.conf\&.<interface>\&.forwarding
sysctl options of the network interface (see
\m[blue]\fBip\-sysctl\&.txt\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
for details about sysctl options)\&. Defaults to
"no"\&.
.sp
Note: unless this option is turned on, or set to
"kernel", no IP forwarding is done on this interface, even if this is globally turned on in the kernel, with the
net\&.ipv4\&.ip_forward
and
net\&.ipv4\&.ip_forward
sysctl options\&.
.RE
.PP

.RE
.PP
\fICriticalConnection=\fR
