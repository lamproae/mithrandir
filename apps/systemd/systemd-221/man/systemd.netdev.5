.SH "NAME"
systemd.netdev \- Virtual Network Device configuration
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
\fInetdev\fR\&.netdev
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Network setup is performed by
\fBsystemd-networkd\fR(8)\&.
.PP
Virtual Network Device files must have the extension
\&.netdev; other extensions are ignored\&. Virtual network devices are created as soon as networkd is started\&. If a netdev with the specified name already exists, networkd will use that as\-is rather than create its own\&. Note that the settings of the pre\-existing netdev will not be changed by networkd\&.
.PP
The
\&.netdev
files are read from the files located in the system network directory
/usr/lib/systemd/network, the volatile runtime network directory
/run/systemd/network
and the local administration network directory
/etc/systemd/network\&. All configuration files are collectively sorted and processed in lexical order, regardless of the directories in which they live\&. However, files with identical filenames replace each other\&. Files in
/etc
have the highest priority, files in
/run
take precedence over files with the same name in
/usr/lib\&. This can be used to override a system\-supplied configuration file with a local file if needed; a symlink in
/etc
with the same name as a configuration file in
/usr/lib, pointing to
/dev/null, disables the configuration file entirely\&.
.SH "SUPPORTED NETDEV KINDS"

Normally, bonding will drop duplicate frames (received on inactive ports), which is desirable for most users\&. But there are some times it is nice to allow duplicate frames to be delivered\&. The default value is false (drop duplicate frames received on inactive ports)\&.
