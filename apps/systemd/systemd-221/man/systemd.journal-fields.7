.SH "NAME"
systemd.journal-fields \- Special journal fields
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Entries in the journal resemble an environment block in their syntax but with fields that can include binary data\&. Primarily, fields are formatted UTF\-8 text strings, and binary formatting is used only where formatting as UTF\-8 text strings makes little sense\&. New fields may freely be defined by applications, but a few fields have special meaning\&. All fields with special meanings are optional\&. In some cases, fields may appear more than once per entry\&.
.SH "USER JOURNAL FIELDS"
.PP
User fields are fields that are directly passed from clients and stored in the journal\&.
.PP
\fIMESSAGE=\fR
.RS 4
The human\-readable message string for this entry\&. This is supposed to be the primary text shown to the user\&. It is usually not translated (but might be in some cases), and is not supposed to be parsed for meta data\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIMESSAGE_ID=\fR
.RS 4
A 128\-bit message identifier ID for recognizing certain message types, if this is desirable\&. This should contain a 128\-bit ID formatted as a lower\-case hexadecimal string, without any separating dashes or suchlike\&. This is recommended to be a UUID\-compatible ID, but this is not enforced, and formatted differently\&. Developers can generate a new ID for this purpose with
\fBjournalctl \fR\fB\fB\-\-new\-id\fR\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIPRIORITY=\fR
.RS 4
A priority value between 0 ("emerg") and 7 ("debug") formatted as a decimal string\&. This field is compatible with syslog\*(Aqs priority concept\&.
.RE
.PP
\fICODE_FILE=\fR, \fICODE_LINE=\fR, \fICODE_FUNC=\fR
.RS 4
The code location generating this message, if known\&. Contains the source filename, the line number and the function name\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIERRNO=\fR
.RS 4
The low\-level Unix error number causing this entry, if any\&. Contains the numeric value of
\fBerrno\fR(3)
formatted as a decimal string\&.
.RE
.PP
\fISYSLOG_FACILITY=\fR, \fISYSLOG_IDENTIFIER=\fR, \fISYSLOG_PID=\fR
.RS 4
Syslog compatibility fields containing the facility (formatted as decimal string), the identifier string (i\&.e\&. "tag"), and the client PID\&. (Note that the tag is usually derived from glibc\*(Aqs
\fIprogram_invocation_short_name\fR
variable, see
\fBprogram_invocation_short_name\fR(3)\&.)
.RE
.SH "TRUSTED JOURNAL FIELDS"
.PP
Fields prefixed with an underscore are trusted fields, i\&.e\&. fields that are implicitly added by the journal and cannot be altered by client code\&.
.PP
\fI_PID=\fR, \fI_UID=\fR, \fI_GID=\fR
.RS 4
The process, user, and group ID of the process the journal entry originates from formatted as a decimal string\&.

.RE
.PP
\fI_SELINUX_CONTEXT=\fR
.RS 4
The SELinux security context (label) of the process the journal entry originates from\&.
.RE
.PP
\fI_SOURCE_REALTIME_TIMESTAMP=\fR
.RS 4
The earliest trusted timestamp of the message, if any is known that is different from the reception time of the journal\&. This is the time in microseconds since the epoch UTC, formatted as a decimal string\&.
.RE
.PP
\fI_BOOT_ID=\fR
.RS 4
The kernel boot ID for the boot the message was generated in, formatted as a 128\-bit hexadecimal string\&.

.RE
.SH "KERNEL JOURNAL FIELDS"
.PP
Kernel fields are fields that are used by messages originating in the kernel and stored in the journal\&.
.PP
\fI_KERNEL_DEVICE=\fR
.RS 4
The kernel device name\&. If the entry is associated to a block device, the major and minor of the device node, separated by
":"
and prefixed by
"b"\&. Similar for character devices but prefixed by
"c"\&. For network devices, this is the interface index prefixed by
"n"\&. For all other devices, this is the subsystem name prefixed by
"+", followed by
":", followed by the kernel device name\&.
.RE
.PP
\fI_KERNEL_SUBSYSTEM=\fR
.RS 4
The kernel subsystem name\&.
.RE
.PP

coredump kernel helper:
.PP
\fICOREDUMP_UNIT=\fR, \fICOREDUMP_USER_UNIT=\fR
.RS 4
Used to annotate messages containing coredumps from system and session units\&. See
\fBcoredumpctl\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
Privileged programs (currently UID 0) may attach
\fIOBJECT_PID=\fR
to a message\&. This will instruct
\fBsystemd\-journald\fR
to attach additional fields on behalf of the caller:
.PP
\fIOBJECT_PID=\fR\fI\fIPID\fR\fR
.RS 4
PID of the program that this message pertains to\&.
.RE
.PP
\fIOBJECT_UID=\fR, \fIOBJECT_GID=\fR, \fIOBJECT_COMM=\fR, \fIOBJECT_EXE=\fR, \fIOBJECT_CMDLINE=\fR, \fIOBJECT_AUDIT_SESSION=\fR, \fIOBJECT_AUDIT_LOGINUID=\fR, \fIOBJECT_SYSTEMD_CGROUP=\fR, \fIOBJECT_SYSTEMD_SESSION=\fR, \fIOBJECT_SYSTEMD_OWNER_UID=\fR, \fIOBJECT_SYSTEMD_UNIT=\fR, \fIOBJECT_SYSTEMD_USER_UNIT=\fR
.RS 4

\fBsystemd\-journald\fR\&. Their meaning is the same as
\fI_UID=\fR,
\fI_GID=\fR,
\fI_COMM=\fR,
\fI_EXE=\fR,
\fI_CMDLINE=\fR,
\fI_AUDIT_SESSION=\fR,
\fI_AUDIT_LOGINUID=\fR,
\fI_SYSTEMD_CGROUP=\fR,
\fI_SYSTEMD_SESSION=\fR,
\fI_SYSTEMD_UNIT=\fR,
\fI_SYSTEMD_USER_UNIT=\fR, and
\fI_SYSTEMD_OWNER_UID=\fR

\fIPID\fR
is described, instead of the process which logged the message\&.
.RE
.SH "ADDRESS FIELDS"
.PP
During serialization into external formats, such as the
\m[blue]\fBJournal Export Format\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
or the
\m[blue]\fBJournal JSON Format\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2, the addresses of journal entries are serialized into fields prefixed with double underscores\&. Note that these are not proper fields when stored in the journal but for addressing metadata of entries\&. They cannot be written as part of structured log entries via calls such as
\fBsd_journal_send\fR(3)\&. They may also not be used as matches for
\fBsd_journal_add_match\fR(3)
.PP
\fI__CURSOR=\fR
.RS 4
The cursor for the entry\&. A cursor is an opaque text string that uniquely describes the position of an entry in the journal and is portable across machines, platforms and journal files\&.
.RE
.PP
\fI__REALTIME_TIMESTAMP=\fR
.RS 4
The wallclock time (\fBCLOCK_REALTIME\fR) at the point in time the entry was received by the journal, in microseconds since the epoch UTC, formatted as a decimal string\&. This has different properties from
"_SOURCE_REALTIME_TIMESTAMP=", as it is usually a bit later but more likely to be monotonic\&.
.RE
.PP
\fI__MONOTONIC_TIMESTAMP=\fR
.RS 4
The monotonic time (\fBCLOCK_MONOTONIC\fR) at the point in time the entry was received by the journal in microseconds, formatted as a decimal string\&. To be useful as an address for the entry, this should be combined with the boot ID in
"_BOOT_ID="\&.
