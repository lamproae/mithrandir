.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBsystemctl\fR\ 'u
\fBsystemctl\fR [OPTIONS...] COMMAND [NAME...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBsystemctl\fR
may be used to introspect and control the state of the
"systemd"
system and service manager\&. Please refer to
\fBsystemd\fR(1)
for an introduction into the basic concepts and functionality this tool manages\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
The following options are understood:
.PP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-type=\fR
.RS 4
The argument should be a comma\-separated list of unit types such as
\fBservice\fR
and
\fBsocket\fR\&.
.sp
If one of the arguments is a unit type, when listing units, limit display to certain unit types\&. Otherwise, units of all types will be shown\&.
.sp
As a special case, if one of the arguments is
\fBhelp\fR, a list of allowed values will be printed and the program will exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-state=\fR
.RS 4
The argument should be a comma\-separated list of unit LOAD, SUB, or ACTIVE states\&. When listing units, show only those in specified states\&. Use
\fB\-\-state=failed\fR
to show only failed units\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-property=\fR
.RS 4
When showing unit/job/manager properties with the
\fBshow\fR
command, limit display to certain properties as specified as argument\&. If not specified, all set properties are shown\&. The argument should be a comma\-separated list of property names, such as
"MainPID"\&. If specified more than once, all properties with the specified names are shown\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-all\fR
.RS 4
When listing units, show all loaded units, regardless of their state, including inactive units\&. When showing unit/job/manager properties, show all properties regardless whether they are set or not\&.
.sp
To list all units installed on the system, use the
\fBlist\-unit\-files\fR
command instead\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-recursive\fR
.RS 4
When listing units, also show units of local containers\&. Units of local containers will be prefixed with the container name, separated by a single colon character (":")\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-reverse\fR
.RS 4
Show reverse dependencies between units with
\fBlist\-dependencies\fR, i\&.e\&. follow dependencies of type
\fIWantedBy=\fR,
\fIRequiredBy=\fR,
\fIRequiredByOverridable=\fR,
\fIPartOf=\fR,
\fIBoundBy=\fR, instead of
\fIWants=\fR
and similar\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-after\fR
.RS 4
With
\fBlist\-dependencies\fR, show the units that are ordered before the specified unit\&. In other words, recursively list units following the
\fIAfter=\fR
dependency\&.
.sp
Note that any
\fIAfter=\fR
dependency is automatically mirrored to create a
\fIBefore=\fR
dependency\&. Temporal dependencies may be specified explicitly, but are also created implicitly for units which are
\fIWantedBy=\fR
targets (see
\fBsystemd.target\fR(5)), and as a result of other directives (for example
\fIRequiresMountsFor=\fR)\&. Both explicitly and implicitly introduced dependencies are shown with
\fBlist\-dependencies\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-before\fR
.RS 4
With
\fBlist\-dependencies\fR, show the units that are ordered after the specified unit\&. In other words, recursively list units following the
\fIBefore=\fR
dependency\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-full\fR
.RS 4
Do not ellipsize unit names, process tree entries, journal output, or truncate unit descriptions in the output of
\fBstatus\fR,
\fBlist\-units\fR,
\fBlist\-jobs\fR, and
\fBlist\-timers\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-show\-types\fR
.RS 4
When showing sockets, show the type of the socket\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-job\-mode=\fR
.RS 4
When queuing a new job, this option controls how to deal with already queued jobs\&. It takes one of
"fail",
"replace",
"replace\-irreversibly",
"isolate",
"ignore\-dependencies",
"ignore\-requirements"
or
"flush"\&. Defaults to
"replace", except when the
\fBisolate\fR
command is used which implies the
"isolate"
job mode\&.
.sp
If
"fail"
is specified and a requested operation conflicts with a pending job (more specifically: causes an already pending start job to be reversed into a stop job or vice versa), cause the operation to fail\&.
.sp
If
"replace"
(the default) is specified, any conflicting pending job will be replaced, as necessary\&.
.sp
If
"replace\-irreversibly"
is specified, operate like
"replace", but also mark the new jobs as irreversible\&. This prevents future conflicting transactions from replacing these jobs (or even being enqueued while the irreversible jobs are still pending)\&. Irreversible jobs can still be cancelled using the
\fBcancel\fR
command\&.
.sp
"isolate"
is only valid for start operations and causes all other units to be stopped when the specified unit is started\&. This mode is always used when the
\fBisolate\fR
command is used\&.
.sp
"flush"
will cause all queued jobs to be canceled when the new job is enqueued\&.
.sp
If
"ignore\-dependencies"
is specified, then all unit dependencies are ignored for this new job and the operation is executed immediately\&. If passed, no required units of the unit passed will be pulled in, and no ordering dependencies will be honored\&. This is mostly a debugging and rescue tool for the administrator and should not be used by applications\&.
.sp
"ignore\-requirements"
is similar to
"ignore\-dependencies", but only causes the requirement dependencies to be ignored, the ordering dependencies will still be honoured\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-ignore\-inhibitors\fR
.RS 4
When system shutdown or a sleep state is requested, ignore inhibitor locks\&. Applications can establish inhibitor locks to avoid that certain important operations (such as CD burning or suchlike) are interrupted by system shutdown or a sleep state\&. Any user may take these locks and privileged users may override these locks\&. If any locks are taken, shutdown and sleep state requests will normally fail (regardless of whether privileged or not) and a list of active locks is printed\&. However, if
\fB\-\-ignore\-inhibitors\fR
is specified, the locks are ignored and not printed, and the operation attempted anyway, possibly requiring additional privileges\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
.RS 4
Suppress output to standard output in
\fBsnapshot\fR,
\fBis\-active\fR,
\fBis\-failed\fR,
\fBis\-enabled\fR,
\fBis\-system\-running\fR,
\fBenable\fR
and
\fBdisable\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-block\fR
.RS 4
Do not synchronously wait for the requested operation to finish\&. If this is not specified, the job will be verified, enqueued and
\fBsystemctl\fR
will wait until the unit\*(Aqs start\-up is completed\&. By passing this argument, it is only verified and enqueued\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-user\fR
.RS 4
Talk to the service manager of the calling user, rather than the service manager of the system\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-system\fR
.RS 4
Talk to the service manager of the system\&. This is the implied default\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-wall\fR
.RS 4
Do not send wall message before halt, power\-off, reboot\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-global\fR
.RS 4
When used with
\fBenable\fR
and
\fBdisable\fR, operate on the global user configuration directory, thus enabling or disabling a unit file globally for all future logins of all users\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-reload\fR
.RS 4
When used with
\fBenable\fR
and
\fBdisable\fR, do not implicitly reload daemon configuration after executing the changes\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-no\-ask\-password\fR
.RS 4
When used with
\fBstart\fR
and related commands, disables asking for passwords\&. Background services may require input of a password or passphrase string, for example to unlock system hard disks or cryptographic certificates\&. Unless this option is specified and the command is invoked from a terminal,
\fBsystemctl\fR
will query the user on the terminal for the necessary secrets\&. Use this option to switch this behavior off\&. In this case, the password must be supplied by some other means (for example graphical password agents) or the service might fail\&. This also disables querying the user for authentication for privileged operations\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-kill\-who=\fR
.RS 4
When used with
\fBkill\fR, choose which processes to send a signal to\&. Must be one of
\fBmain\fR,
\fBcontrol\fR
or
\fBall\fR
to select whether to kill only the main process, the control process or all processes of the unit\&. The main process of the unit is the one that defines the life\-time of it\&. A control process of a unit is one that is invoked by the manager to induce state changes of it\&. For example, all processes started due to the
\fIExecStartPre=\fR,
\fIExecStop=\fR
or
\fIExecReload=\fR
settings of service units are control processes\&. Note that there is only one control process per unit at a time, as only one state change is executed at a time\&. For services of type
\fIType=forking\fR, the initial process started by the manager for
\fIExecStart=\fR
is a control process, while the process ultimately forked off by that one is then considered the main process of the unit (if it can be determined)\&. This is different for service units of other types, where the process forked off by the manager for
\fIExecStart=\fR
is always the main process itself\&. A service unit consists of zero or one main process, zero or one control process plus any number of additional processes\&. Not all unit types manage processes of these types however\&. For example, for mount units, control processes are defined (which are the invocations of
/usr/bin/mount
and
/usr/bin/umount), but no main process is defined\&. If omitted, defaults to
\fBall\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-signal=\fR
.RS 4
When used with
\fBkill\fR, choose which signal to send to selected processes\&. Must be one of the well known signal specifiers such as
\fBSIGTERM\fR,
\fBSIGINT\fR
or
\fBSIGSTOP\fR\&. If omitted, defaults to
\fBSIGTERM\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
.RS 4
When used with
\fBenable\fR, overwrite any existing conflicting symlinks\&.
.sp
When used with
\fBhalt\fR,
\fBpoweroff\fR,
\fBreboot\fR
or
\fBkexec\fR, execute the selected operation without shutting down all units\&. However, all processes will be killed forcibly and all file systems are unmounted or remounted read\-only\&. This is hence a drastic but relatively safe option to request an immediate reboot\&. If
\fB\-\-force\fR
is specified twice for these operations, they will be executed immediately without terminating any processes or unmounting any file systems\&. Warning: specifying
\fB\-\-force\fR
twice with any of these operations might result in data loss\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-now\fR
.RS 4
When used with
\fBenable\fR, the units will also be started\&. When used with
\fBdisable\fR
or
\fBmask\fR, the units will also be stopped\&. The start or stop operation is only carried out when the respective enable or disable operation has been successful\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-root=\fR
.RS 4
When used with
\fBenable\fR/\fBdisable\fR/\fBis\-enabled\fR
(and related commands), use alternative root path when looking for unit files\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-runtime\fR
.RS 4
When used with
\fBenable\fR,
\fBdisable\fR,
\fBedit\fR, (and related commands), make changes only temporarily, so that they are lost on the next reboot\&. This will have the effect that changes are not made in subdirectories of
/etc
but in
/run, with identical immediate effects, however, since the latter is lost on reboot, the changes are lost too\&.
.sp
Similarly, when used with
\fBset\-property\fR, make changes only temporarily, so that they are lost on the next reboot\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-preset\-mode=\fR
.RS 4
Takes one of
"full"

.RE
.PP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-lines=\fR

When used with
\fBstatus\fR, controls the number of journal lines to show, counting from the most recent ones\&. Takes a positive integer argument\&. Defaults to 10\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output=\fR

.RS 4
Start (activate) one or more units specified on the command line\&.
.sp
Note that glob patterns operate on a list of currently loaded units\&. Units which are not active and are not in a failed state usually are not loaded, and would not be matched by any pattern\&. In addition, in case of instantiated units, systemd is often unaware of the instance name until the instance has been started\&. Therefore, using glob patterns with
\fBstart\fR
has limited usefulness\&.

.RS 4
Asks all units listed on the command line to reload their configuration\&. Note that this will reload the service\-specific configuration, not the unit configuration file of systemd\&. If you want systemd to reload the configuration file of a unit, use the
\fBdaemon\-reload\fR
command\&. In other words: for the example case of Apache, this will reload Apache\*(Aqs

While this command is the recommended way to manipulate the unit configuration directory, the administrator is free to make additional changes manually by placing or removing symlinks in the directory\&. This is particularly useful to create configurations that deviate from the suggested default installation\&. In this case, the administrator must make sure to invoke
\fBdaemon\-reload\fR
manually as necessary to ensure the changes are taken into account\&.
.sp
Enabling units should not be confused with starting (activating) units, as done by the
\fBstart\fR
command\&. Enabling and starting units is orthogonal: units may be enabled without being started and started without being enabled\&. Enabling simply hooks the unit into various suggested places (for example, so that the unit is automatically started on boot or when a particular kind of hardware is plugged in)\&. Starting actually spawns the daemon process (in case of service units), or binds the socket (in case of socket units), and so on\&.
.sp
Depending on whether
\fB\-\-system\fR,
\fB\-\-user\fR,
\fB\-\-runtime\fR, or
\fB\-\-global\fR

Depending on whether
