  Subject: sh-utils-1.16c, pinky.c (lightweight finger) included ...
  Cc: ghazi@caip.rutgers.edu

	  I've completed hacking who.c into a passable pinky.c.  It
  probably needs more work, but I'd like to get it in the next beta
  release of sh-utils so others can play with it (ie complete it for me)
  bazaar style. :-)

	  The most notable missing pieces of functionality are "@host"
  support, no expansion of '&' from gecos [Done, now] and the -m flag.
  There are also probably behavior differences from what one should expect
  from a traditional unix finger, which anyone is free to correct if they know
  what I implemented wrong.
